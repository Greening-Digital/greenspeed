# Greenspeed

We all know the internet uses electricity, and because most of it runs on fossil fuels, it means there's an environmental impact to using the web.

Greenspeed is an open source hosted service to help you understand how a website or application can have a carbon footprint, and how to make measurable improvements that make it greener, more accessibler and faster.

It does this by using a popular open soure tool, sitespeed to analyse your site, along with peer reviewed science to provide tailored advice about where to make improvements first.

### How to use it

1. When you visit greenspeed in your browser, enter the url of the page you want to analyse.
2. Let Greenspeed do its work
3. See the results - you'll see how your site compared to data on regularly updated dataset of the most popular sites on the internet, provided by the HTTP Archive.

Once you've seen how you're doing, make it habit - we'll check a site for you daily, message you when there's been a significant change, so you can make comparisons with how were doing before.

If you want to go further into the world of sustainable web and web monitoring, or have specific needs, see the [open source sitespeed dashboard tools][2].
